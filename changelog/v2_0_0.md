## v2.0.0

### Features
#### Psychoacoustic functions
Implementation of conversion functions between Hz and Bark, Mel, ERB, ERB-rate scale (Cams).  
Helper functions for decibels.

Cochleagram computation as output of a gammatone filter-bank.  
Generalized time-frequency representations plots.

Perceptual losses: Mel-spectrogram Loss, Multiscale Spectral Loss, Cochleagram Loss.

#### Linear algebra
Decorator for functions operating on numpy arrays for automating the allocation of the output array, to avoid multiple allocations.  
Strided convolution utility for faster low-resolution convolution outputs.

#### Optimization
Hyperparameter optimization wrapper for Bayesian optimizaiton of SAMPLE parameters.

#### Beats
Random generator of beating modal partials.
Modal beat model.
DualBeat regression.

### GUI
Add spacers between parameters sections.  
Add "Export WAV" button.

### Notebooks
Added "Automatic Tuning of SAMPLE hyperparameters" notebook.
