## v1.4.0
### Features
#### Frequency reduction
A custom function can now be provided to reduce the array of frequency of each
track into a single frequency. This is mainly intended to provide a way to
switch between mean and median
#### Settable properties
Learned properties (frequencies, decays, amplitudes) can now be setted. This
allows post-fit manipulations, e.g. pitch-shift
### Improvements
Now forcing correct package version in notebooks. Also using quiet mode instead
of clearing output
