## v1.2.0
### Features
#### Reverse mode
Added reverse mode: sinusoidal model will (optionally) process audio in reverse. 
This option was already implemented in the prototypal software for the paper,
but missing from this package.

### BugFixes
#### HingeRegression default linear_regressor
HingeRegression instances with default linear_regressor used to share the same
linear_regressor instance. Now assignment is performed on a deepcopy of the
parameter value (via property setter).
