## v2.1.0

### Features
Integrate BeatsDROP in SAMPLE with decisors.  
Plot beats as dashed lines in plots.  
No zero-padding by default.  
Nested collapsible HTML menu to inspect model arguments in IPython.  
Officially supporting Python 3.11.  

### Fixes
Refactor encapsulation of models to be compliant with the sklearn API.
This also affects argument names. These changes are non-breaking, since old
names are still supported, although deprecated (a warning will be printed).  
Adjust amplitude optimization boundaries based on initial values (ensure feasibility
of starting point).  
Limit numpy version to avoid [issue #1138](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/issues/1138) in skopt.  

### Performance
Optionally fit BeatsDROP to trajectories in parallel (multiprocessing).  
Use overlapping_windows to compute time-frames.  
More robust margins in beat regression bounds.  

### GUI
Plot beats as dashed lines in GUI.  
Add zero-padding toggle to GUI settings.  
Thread lock for analysis.
Major refactoring of GUI internals to accomodate multiprocessing BeatsDROP.
