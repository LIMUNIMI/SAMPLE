## v2.1.0

### Features
Integrate BeatsDROP in SAMPLE with decisors.  
Plot beats as dashed lines in plots.  
No zero-padding by default.  

### Fixes
Refactor encapsulation of models to be compliant with the sklearn API.
This also affects argument names. These changes are non-breaking, since old
names are still supported, although deprecated (a warning will be printed).  
Adjust amplitude optimization boundaries based on initial values (ensure feasibility
of starting point).  

### Performance
Optionally fit BeatsDROP to trajectories in parallel (multiprocessing).  
Use overlapping_windows to compute time-frames.  

### GUI
Plot beats as dashed lines in GUI.  
Add zero-padding toggle to GUI settings.  
Thread lock for analysis.
Major refactoring of GUI internals to accomodate multiprocessing BeatsDROP.
